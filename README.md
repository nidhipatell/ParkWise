# ParkWise

In congested cities like Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, parking is difficult to find. ParkWise is a
web-based service that allows people to park on other peopleâ€™s driveways for a cheaper price
and closer to their destination. House owners can list their driveways for parking and customers
can rent their driveway through on the site. This will allow them to book a guaranteed spot
during their travel. The problem that is being solved is that there are tourists that do not need to
pay high prices for a limited amount of time. Having our service, they would save the high cost
of parking in such cities and reduce the time needed to find parking in busy places.
